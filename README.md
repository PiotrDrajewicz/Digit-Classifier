# Digit-Classifier
Algorithm that can recognise digits by voice recordings.
## General info
This project is made on Google Colab platform. File management is done with pickle module. Classification process is done with use of MFCCs, GMMs and leave-one-out method as cross-validation. The project also includes research on various hiperparameters and its effect on algorithms efficiency as well as recognition rate.
